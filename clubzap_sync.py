"""
ClubZap Fixture Sync Tool

Manages differential uploads to ClubZap by tracking what's already been uploaded.
Generates:
  - new_fixtures.csv      -> bulk import these into ClubZap
  - changed_fixtures.csv  -> review and manually update in ClubZap
  - removed_fixtures.csv  -> manually delete from ClubZap

Usage:
  py clubzap_sync.py diff      -> generate diff files (new/changed/removed)
  py clubzap_sync.py uploaded  -> mark current fixtures as uploaded (update baseline)
  py clubzap_sync.py status    -> show sync status
