# Ballincollig GAA Fixture Manager

An automated system that keeps the club's ClubZap fixtures in sync with the Cork County Board website — no manual data entry required.

## The Problem

Every week, the Cork County Board publishes and updates fixtures on **gaacork.ie** — new games, time changes, venue swaps, postponements. A club volunteer then has to:

1. Manually check the county board website for updates
2. Log into **ClubZap** and type in every new fixture, edit, or cancellation
3. Do this across **every age grade** — Seniors, Juniors, Minors, U14s, U16s, U21s — potentially dozens of fixtures per week

ClubZap supports bulk creation of fixtures via CSV upload, but **does not support bulk editing or bulk deletion**. When the county board changes a time, venue, or referee — which happens constantly — each fixture must be edited individually by hand. This is tedious, error-prone, and things get missed. Players and parents end up with wrong information in the club app.

## The Solution

This system completely automates that process:

1. **Checks the county board website every morning at 6am** — automatically, no human needed
2. **Spots any changes** — new fixtures, time or venue changes, referee assignments, postponements, cancellations
3. **Updates ClubZap automatically** — adds new fixtures via CSV upload, edits changed ones individually (solving the bulk-edit gap), and removes cancelled ones
4. **Sends a phone notification** — whoever is subscribed gets an instant alert with exactly what changed (e.g. "Senior Football vs Nemo Rangers moved from 3pm to 7:30pm, venue changed to Pairc Ui Rinn")
5. **If nothing changed, sends an "all clear"** — so you know it's running and nothing was missed

## What It Means for the Club

- **No more volunteer hours** spent on fixture data entry
- **No more missed updates** — every change the county board makes is caught within 24 hours
- **Players and parents always have accurate info** in the ClubZap app
- **Covers all teams automatically** — it knows which competition maps to which age grade (e.g. "McCarthy Insurance Premier SFC" = Senior Football)
- **Handles edge cases** — postponed games, referee TBC, home vs away, and filters out non-GAA fixtures (rugby etc.)

## How It Works

 [ Scraper ]         Checks the website daily using a headless browser

 [ Notifications ]    Push alerts to phone via ntfy.sh with the club crest
                      Includes "Open ClubZap" button — per-team topics available
```

## How It Runs

The system runs for free on **GitHub Actions** (a cloud service) — no club server or computer needs to be left on. It checks once a day at 6am, and can also be triggered manually at any time. All fixture data is archived for 30 days.

## Notifications

Every notification includes a **"Open ClubZap"** button that links directly to the fixtures dashboard.

### All-Fixtures Notifications

Subscribe to **all** fixture changes across every team:

- **Topic:** `ballincollig-gaa-fixtures`
- **Subscribe:** [ntfy.sh/ballincollig-gaa-fixtures](https://ntfy.sh/ballincollig-gaa-fixtures)

### Per-Team Notifications (for managers)

Team managers can subscribe to notifications for **only their team**. When a fixture changes, only the teams affected receive a notification — no noise from other age grades.

## Safety

- On its first run, it won't bulk-upload everything — it waits for confirmation to prevent duplicates
- If an edit fails (e.g. ClubZap is temporarily down), it retries automatically on the next run
- The club's ClubZap login credentials are stored securely as encrypted secrets — never visible in code or logs

## Next Steps

### LGFA (Ladies Football) Support

The county board website already publishes LGFA fixtures alongside the men's games. The system currently filters these out, but enabling them is straightforward:

- Remove the LGFA exclusion filter
- Add team name mappings so LGFA competitions (e.g. "LGFA Junior A Football") map to the correct ClubZap team names
- Ensure the corresponding LGFA teams are set up in ClubZap

This is a small change and could be turned on quickly once the ClubZap team names are confirmed.

### Camogie Support

Camogie fixtures are managed by a separate county board and are likely published on a different website (e.g. Cork Camogie or Foireann). Supporting Camogie would require:

- Identifying where Ballincollig Camogie fixtures are published online
- Building a scraper for that site (different page structure to gaacork.ie)
- Adding team name mappings for Camogie competitions
- Merging Camogie fixtures into the same pipeline so they sync to ClubZap alongside GAA and LGFA fixtures

### Other Potential Enhancements

- **Clash detection** — Flag when two club teams are scheduled at the same time, or when dual players have overlapping fixtures across codes
- **Change audit trail** — Track every fixture change over the season for AGM reporting or raising scheduling concerns with the county board

## Technical Details

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Run the full pipeline (scrape + detect changes + notify)
python enhanced_monitor.py

# Just check what needs syncing to ClubZap
python clubzap_sync.py diff

# Sync changes to ClubZap (requires CLUBZAP_EMAIL and CLUBZAP_PASSWORD env vars)
python clubzap_automate.py
```
